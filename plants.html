<p>Having a bird’s nest fern in your home is an instant conversation starter, thanks to its bright green, ripple-edged fronds. You'll score major cool points with this signature-looking plant, especially if you put it in a hanging planter, as Marino recommends. 
Because the bird's nest fern thrives in medium indirect light and a humid environment,"it would do great in a bathroom with a shower, as long as there are windows that receive natural light.Ferns have been shown to filter formaldehyde, xylene, and toluene, so it's not a bad idea to put one in your bathroom. After all, that's where you're likely to use household toxins, like harsh cleaners, hairspray, and nail polish remover that often contain these chemicals.

<p>Bright, indirect sun is the best for this plant, but be careful with watering: It requires a "drench-and-dry" approach (water thoroughly, then let the soil dry out), along with weekly misting. The unusual round leaves make a dramatic impression, so it's best to keep the pot simple, like this display from The Joy of Plants.</p><br></br>

<p>3] It has a very unique look. </p><br></br>

<p><b>How to Care?</b></p>
<p>Light: It prefers bright, indirect light. Direct sun may burn the leaves.</p>
<p>Water: Typically, deeply watering this plant once a week will suffice, but it will depend on the amount and quality of light it is receiving.
